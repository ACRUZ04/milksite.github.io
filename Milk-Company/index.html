        <p>Outpost began in 2012 with the belief that milk and its natural health benefits can be used to create great tasting products that nourish 
        consumers and fit into their modern lifestyles. We specialize in delicious, dairy-based products to give everyone the nutrition they need, 
        but we know our products are only one piece of a much larger purpose.Today, our vision extends far beyond the bottle. 
        By harnessing the power of curiosity and innovation, we can strive for more than delicious dairyâ€”we can work to make the world a better place.</p>
